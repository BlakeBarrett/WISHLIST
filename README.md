# WISHLIST
Chart and Graph the things you want: segment by any vector.

# How it Works

## Step 1. Create a list
A list is just a collection of "wants".
Lists can be private or shared.
Shared lists can be collaborated on.
Examples of lists would be:
 * Grocery items
 * Christmas shopping
 * Dream Cars
 * The possibilities are endless...

## Step 2. Add your "Wants"
 * What are the things you want?
 * Link to product on website.
 * List their attributes:   
   * Price  
   * Level of Desire   
   * Level of "Need"   
   * etc...  

## Step 3. Segment by anything
 * What are the things that I want that I can afford?
 * What are some of the things I _really_ want, but need to save for?

## Step 4. Price alerts
 * Set a notification for `[Product X]` at price-point `[Y]` on `[website]`.
